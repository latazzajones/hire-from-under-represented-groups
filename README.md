# hire-from-under-represented-groups
A list of organizations that you can submit job listings to actively ensure that your hiring practices are diverse and inclusive. Inspired by [speakers-who-want-a-platform](https://github.com/iheanyi/speakers-who-want-a-platform).

Anyone who manages a social media network or professional organization that explicitly serves an underrepresented group in tech is welcome to add the group to this list.

Please check out the CONTRIBUTING.md file for guidelines for contributing.
