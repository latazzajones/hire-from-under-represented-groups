# hire-from-under-represented-groups
A list of organizations that you can submit job listings to actively ensure that your hiring practices are diverse and inclusive. Inspired by [speakers-who-want-a-platform](https://github.com/iheanyi/speakers-who-want-a-platform).

Anyone who manages a social media network or professional organization that explicitly serves an underrepresented group in tech is welcome to add that group to here.
